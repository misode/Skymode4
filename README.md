It features lots of [modules](https://github.com/misode/Skymode4/wiki/Modules) made by the community, [Gamemode 4](https://gm4.co/modules/) and custom made for this project. The first alpha releases are out now. Feel free to look around on the [wiki](https://github.com/misode/Skymode4/wiki) or in the code.
